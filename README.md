# FA23: Applied Database Technologies
### Final Project: “AppFusion: Where Apps Align with Your Desires”

<br>

##### PROJECT SUMMARY

Our goal with this project is to develop a cutting-edge app recommendation system. We've gathered a vast amount of app data, boasting over 1.2 million records sourced from the Apple App Store, courtesy of Kaggle. The team will focus on enhancing how people discover and receive app recommendations, primarily through a dedicated database project.

We're strongly emphasizing data-driven methods, honing in on various attributes within the dataset such as 'App_Name,' 'Primary_Genre,' 'Content_Rating,' and more. The database system will generate personalized app suggestions with meticulous attention to detail. This is possible by allowing users to precisely specify their preferences and consider factors like genre, content rating, and additional app attributes.

The above-presented approach to the app recommendation system aims to boost user engagement and promote well-informed suggestions in mobile apps. Our project places a premium on customization, aiming to offer the ultimate source for those searching for personalized app recommendations. By leveraging the dataset's depth, we aspire to become the top choice for individuals looking for tailored app suggestions and comprehensive insights into the world of mobile applications.
